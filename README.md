## Technical Reflection Guidelines
Reflection is vital to learning and growth. Objectives and challenges should not be thought of as items to check off; they are your opportunities to learn and grow as a programmer. Be mindful of each of the following questions after solving each challenge:
+ Was your strategy for solving the challenge successful?  
+ What part of your strategy worked? What parts were challenging?
+ What questions did you have while coding? Did you find answers to them?
+ Are there any concepts that are still confusing to you?
