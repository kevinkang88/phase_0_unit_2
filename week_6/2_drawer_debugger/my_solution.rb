# U2.W6: Drawer Debugger


# I worked on this challenge [by myself].


# 2. Original Code

    puts "Your drawer is empty."

# 													Also added attr_reader clean for bonus

# 5. Reflection 

# As we do more refactoring challenges I feel more comfortable looking at other
# peoples codes and figuring out ways to improve them. Also this exercise was 
# good practice in looking at error messages. I was lucky error messages in this
# challenge was straight forward. Sometimes when dealing with errors in loops I 
# realized they donâ€™t always point to right lines of code giving me massive 
# headaches. Also writing driver codes for methods that print strings turned out 
# to be more messy because each time I try to test a code it outputs a string. 
# Maybe RSPEC tests can fix this problem.
