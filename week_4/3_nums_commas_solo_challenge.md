# U2.W4: Separate Numbers with Commas

## Learning Objectives
- Break down problems into implementable pseudocode
- Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content
- Use if/else statements, string methods, while/until loops, Enumerable#each methods
- Use strings, integers, arrays, and/or hashes

## Background


*NOTE: Even if you are comfortable with regular expressions, do not use them in this challenge, it's all about the logic!*

## Directions
 
1. Write [Driver Test Code](../references/driver_code.md)
2. [Pseudocode](../references/pseudocode.md)
3. [Initial Solution](../references/initial_solution.md)
4. [Refactored Solution](../references/refactoring.md)
5. [Reflect](../references/reflection_guidelines.md)
6. Sync your changes (push your solution) to Github
7. [Review](../references/review.md)
