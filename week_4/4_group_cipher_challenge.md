# U2.W4: Group Cipher Challenge

## Learning Objectives
- Read and describe what complicated code is doing
- Automate repetitive tasks using loops
- Decompose a problem into smaller, easier to solve components
- Identify and rewrite repetitive code

## Background
The N.S.A. just broke Kim Jong Un's cipher that he's been using to give instructions to his military commanders! We wrote the following program to decipher the messages. As the N.S.A.'s best programmer on staff, your job is to refactor the code. 

## Directions 

In this challenge, you'll work with a pari to refactor some existing code to make it more readable and follow ruby best practices. Then you will compare your solution with the other pair(s) in your accountability groups. 


1. Run the code to see what the expected output is
2. Write driver test code for each test.
3. Copy the initial code and identify what each line of code is doing. Write comments next to each line with an explanation.
4. [Refactor (by rewriting) the initial solution](../references/refactoring.md)
  - Clean up the variable names. 
  - The original code used a hard-coded hash to do the encryption. Can you create a simple algorithm instead? The original shift was by 4 characters. What would happen if it was changed to 10? 
5. [Reflect](../references/reflection_guidelines.md)
6. Sync your changes (push your solution) to Github, then email your code to your accountability group.
7. [Review](../references/review.md) the other solutions in your accountability groups. Were the solutions different? What did the others do well or better than you? What did you do well? Comment on each solution.
