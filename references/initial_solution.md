Translate your pseudocode into code. If your pseudocode 
is not easy to implement, modify it, and re-attempt to code it. 

When you think your code should pass the first failing test, run the spec file again 
using the `rspec` command. If it passes, work on translating the next bit of pseudocode
to pass the next test. If it fails, try to figure out why it's still failing and modify
your code accordingly.

When you've passed each test, give yourself a pat on the back! Then take a break before 
trying to refactor. It's good to give your eyes a rest so they can more easily see places 
to improve.
